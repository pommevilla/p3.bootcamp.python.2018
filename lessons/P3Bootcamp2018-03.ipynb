    "Python makes it very easy to read and write from files.  In most cases, we will build off of the following lines of code:\n",

    "`open` is a function that takes a file and opens it for your use.  The first argument, `filename`, is the name of the file you want to open.  The second argument, `mode`, is the mode that you want to open that file in.  By default, files are opened in `read` mode (i.e., `mode = r`); you are *only* able to read from the file.  If you would like to open a file *only* to write to, set `mode = w`.  Opening a file with `mode = w` will overwrite whatever is currently in the file.  You can open a file in append mode by passing `mode = a` when you open the file; doing so will add to the end of the file instead of overwriting everything.  Finally, `mode = r+` opens the file for both reading and writing.  In summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "|     Mode    | Access | \n",
    "|:-----------:|:------:|\n",
    "| r (default) | Read only     | \n",
    "|      w      | Write only     |\n",
    "|      r+     | Read and write     |  \n",
    "|      a      | Append     | \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you begin a block of code with the `with open(filename) as my_file` syntax, Python will take care of opening and closing the file for you when control leaves the code block begun by the `with` statement.  The `for line in my_file` line sets up a for loop to iterate through every line in the file.  Finally, write the code you want to perform in the inner-most code block.\n",
